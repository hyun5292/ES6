////Use export to Share a Code Block
/*
Imagine a file called math_functions.js that contains several functions related
to mathematical operations. One of them is stored in a variable, add, that takes
in two numbers and returns their sum. You want to use this function in several
different JavaScript files. In order to share it with these other files, you first
need to export it.
*/
/*
export const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}
*/
/*
The above is a common way to export a single function, but you can achieve the
same thing like this:
*/
/*
const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}
*/
/*
When you export a variable or function, you can import it in another file and use
it without having to rewrite the code. You can export multiple things by repeating
the first example for each thing you want to export, or by placing them all in the
export statement of the second example, like this:
*/
//export { add, substract };
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/*
There are two string-related functions in the editor. Export both of them using
the method of your choice.
*/
/*
const uppercaseString = (string) => {
  return string.toUpperCase();
}

const lowercaseString = (string) => {
  return string.toLowerCase();
}

export { uppercaseString, lowercaseString };
*/
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////Reuse JavaScript Code Using import
/*
import allows you to choose which parts of a file or module to load. In the previous
lesson, the examples exported add from the math_functions.js file. Here's how you
can import it to use in another file:
*/
//import { add } from './math_functions.js';
/*
Here, import will find add in math_functions.js, import just that function for you
to use, and ignore the rest. The ./tells the import to look for the math_functions.js
file in the same folder as the current file. The relative file path (./) and file
extension (.js) are required when using import in this way:
*/
//import { add, subtract } from './math_functions.js';
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/*
Add the appropriate import statement that will allow the current file to use the
uppercaseString and lowercaseString functions you exported in the previous lesson.
These functions are in a file called string_functions.js, which is in the same
directory as the current file
*/
/*
import { uppercaseString, lowercaseString } from './string_functions.js';

uppercaseString("hello");
lowercaseString("WORLD!");
*/
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////Use * to Import Everything from a file
/*
Suppose you have a file and you wish to import all of its contents into the current
file. This can be done with the import * as syntax. Here's an example where the
contents of a file named math_functions.js are imported into a file in the same
directory:
*/
//import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";
/*
The above import statement will create an object called myMatModule. This is just
a variable name, you name it anything. The object will contain all of the exports
from math_functions.js in it, so you can access the functions like you would any
other object property. Here's how you can use the add and subtract functions that
were imported:
*/
//myMathModule.add(2, 3);
//myMathModule.subtract(5, 3);
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/*
The code in this file requires the contents of the file: string_functions.js, that
is in the same directory as the current file. Use the import * as syntax to import
everthing from the file into an object called stringFunctions.
*/
/*
import * as stringFunctions from "./string_functions.js";

stringFunctions.uppercaseString("hello");
stringFunctions.lowercaseString("WORLD!");
*/
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////Create a Export Fallback with export default
/*
In the export lesson, you learned about the syntax referred to as a name export.
This allowed you to make multiple functions and variables available for use in
other files.

There is another export syntax you need to know, known as export default. Usually
you will use this syntax if only one value is being exported from a file. It is
also used to create a fallback value for a file or module.

Below are examples using export default:
*/
/*
export default function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

export default function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
*/
/*
The first is a named function, and the second is an anonymous function.

Since export default is used to declare a fallback value for a module or file,
you can only have one value be a default export in each module or file. Additionally,
you cannot use export default with var, let, or const.
*/
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/*
The following functio should be the fallback value for the module. Please add the
necessary code to do so.
*/
/*
export default function subtract(x, y) {
  return x - y;
}
*/
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////Import a Default Export
/*
In the last challenge, you learned about export default and its uses. To import
a default export, you need to use a different import syntax. In the following
example, add is the default export of the math_functions.js file. Here is how to
import it:
*/
//import add from "./math_functions.js";
/*
The syntax differs in one key place. The imported value, add, is not surrounded
by curly braces ({}), add here is simply a variable name for whatever the default
export of the math_functions.js file is. You can use any name here when importing
a default.
*/
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/*
In the following code, import the default export from the math_functions.js file,
found in the same directory as this file. Give the import the name subtract.
*/
/*
import subtract from "./math_functions.js";

subtract(7, 4);
*/
